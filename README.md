# OCRUG - Advanced Regression Models with R Applications

**Sharpen your Data Science skills with this is a hands-on workshop on advanced regression techniques in R.**

## About this Event

In this workshop we will talk about variety of regression models, give their definitions, discussing goodness-of-fit criteria, presenting fitted models, interpreting estimated regression coefficients, and using the fitted models for prediction. The models will be limited to: linear regression, Box-Cox transformation, gamma regression, ordinary logistic regression, Poisson regression, beta regression, longitudinal (repeated measures) regression, and hierarchical model.

The workshop is designed to be hands-on. Participants are required to bring laptops and be ready to write R, analyzing data and interpreting results. For each model, we present an example with a complete R code, and then will an exercise to work on. Workshop participants should be familiar with algebraic expressions of different probability distributions, and have a fundamental knowledge of simple linear regression: normally distributed random error, continuous and categorical independent variables (requiring creating dummy variables).

The material covered by the workshop will be taken from my recently published book [“Advanced Regression Models with SAS and R Applications”](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1138049018/), CRC Press, 2018.

**We will have a limited number of books for sale. You can purchase the book and get it signed by Dr. Olga.**

## Biography of Dr. Olga Korosteleva

Dr. Olga Korosteleva, is a professor of Statistics at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB). She received her Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics in 1996 from Wayne State University in Detroit, and a Ph.D. in Statistics from Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, in 2002. Since then she has been teaching mostly Statistics courses in the Master’s program in Applied Statistics at CSULB, and loving it!

Dr. Olga is an undergraduate advisor for students majoring in Mathematics with an option in Statistics. She is also the faculty supervisor for the Statistics Student Association. She is also the immediate past-president of the Southern California Chapter of the American Statistical Association (SCASA). Dr. Olga is the editor-in-chief of SCASA’s monthly eNewsletter and the author (co-author) of four statistical books.
