# OCRUG - Advanced Regression Models with R Applications

*Sharpen your Data Science skills with this is a hands-on workshop on advanced regression techniques in R.*

## About this Event

In this workshop we will talk about variety of regression models, give their definitions, discussing goodness-of-fit criteria, presenting fitted models, interpreting estimated regression coefficients, and using the fitted models for prediction. The models will be limited to: linear regression, Box-Cox transformation, gamma regression, ordinary logistic regression, Poisson regression, beta regression, longitudinal (repeated measures) regression, and hierarchical model.

The workshop is designed to be hands-on. Participants are required to bring laptops and be ready to write R, analyzing data and interpreting results. For each model, we present an example with a complete R code, and then will an exercise to work on. Workshop participants should be familiar with algebraic expressions of different probability distributions, and have a fundamental knowledge of simple linear regression: normally distributed random error, continuous and categorical independent variables (requiring creating dummy variables).

The material covered by the workshop will be taken from my recently published book [“Advanced Regression Models with SAS and R Applications”](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1138049018/), CRC Press, 2018.
