Hello:

As part of the Advanced Regression Models with SAS and R workshop, Dr. Olga is happy to present you with an e-book version of the Advanced Regression Models with SAS and R textbook. Please do not distribute this book and just use it for your personal use.

We will have a limited number of printed books for sale during the workshop. Dr. Olga will be happy to autograph it for you.
